# GBA464: RFM analysis on CDNOW data
# Author:
# Description: Lab on functions and loops
# Data: CDNOW customer data (this time full data)
# Source: provided by Professor Bruce Hardie on

# ===================================================

# ====== CLEAR EVERYTHING ======
rm(list = ls())

# ====== READ TRIAL DATA =======

url <- 'CDNOW_sample.txt'
if (!file.exists('CDNOW_sample.txt')) {     # check whether data exists in local folder (prevents downloading every time)
    download.file(url, 'CDNOW_sample.txt')
}
df.raw <- read.fwf('CDNOW_sample.txt', width = c(6, 5, 9, 3, 8), stringsAsFactors = F)  # load data

# ====== Section 2: loading the data ======

df.raw[[1]] <- NULL # drop old id
names(df.raw) <- c("id", "date", "qty", "expd")

# a) generate year and month
 







# b) aggregate into monthly data with number of trips and total expenditure








# c) generate a table of year-months, merge, replace no trip to zero.
# Hint: how do you deal with year-months with no trip? These periods are not in the original data,
#   but you might need to have these periods when you calcualte RFM, right?
# Consider expanding the time frame using expand.grid() but you do not have to.









# now we should have the dataset we need; double check to make sure that every consumer is in every period


# ====== Section 3.1: recency ======
# use repetition statement, such as a "for-loop", to generate a recency measure for each consumer 
#   in each period. Hint: if you get stuck here, take a look at Example 3 when we talked about "for-loops"
#   call it df$recency










# ====== Section 3.2: frequency ======
# first define quarters and collapse/merge data sets
#   quarters should be e.g. 1 for January-March, 1997, 2 for April-June, 1997, ...
#   and there should be 8 quarters in the two-year period
#   Next, let's define frequency purchase occasions in PAST QUARTER
#   Call this df$frequency








# ====== Section 3.3: monetary value ======
# average monthly expenditure in the months with trips (i.e. when expenditure is nonzero)
#   for each individual in each month, find the average expenditure from the beginning to 
#   the PAST MONTH. Call this df$monvalue








# ====== Section 4: Targeting using RFM ======
# now combine these and construct an RFM index
#   You only need to run this section.

b1 <- -0.05
b2 <- 3.5
b3 <- 0.05

df$index <- b1*df$recency + b2*df$frequency + b3*df$monvalue


# validation: check whether the RFM index predict customer purchase patterns
# Order your sample (still defined by keys of consumer-year-month) based on the RFM index. 
#   Split your sample into 10 groups. The first group is top 10% in terms of
#   the RFM index; second group is 10%-20%, etc.
# Make a bar plot on the expected per-trip revenue that these consumers generate and comment on 
#   whether the RFM index help you segment which set of customers are "more valuable"
